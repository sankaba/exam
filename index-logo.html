        <h5>2019 logos for “Year of school societies”</h5>
        <div class="logoflex-r">

            <img src="logo3.png" alt="image of Orchil website design">
        </div>
        <p>problem -  i had to create a logo 
            that would communicate core
            values of the Lithuaniana
            school society, such as 
            enthusiasm, solidarity 
            and knowledge.                   
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> solution - the logo variations
            therefore are in leafy green and 
            ground brown colors. The logos 
            feature human, tree and circle
            symbols  which in unison with the
            colors help to allude to the
            mentioned values.

            <img src="kosto3.png" alt="image of Orchil website design">
        </div>
        <p>problem - while talking to the artist 
            Honeycoasta about his vision
            for an album, he said that 
            he would like a typography
            based logo and that sound 
            waves would be incorporated.           
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>solution - the logo created is
            based on my handwriting
            and is made to look like 
            the letters were distorted
            by sound waves.
