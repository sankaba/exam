                    therefore are in leafy green and 
                    ground brown colors. The logos 
                    feature human, tree and circle
                    symbols  which in unison with the
                    colors help to allude to the
                    mentioned values.

                    a redesign of their whole brand 
                    identity, which would communicate
                    the heritage of the dance better

            researched a lot about 20s and 30s
            when the dance originated. We took 
            inspiration from Art Deco and created
            an monogramic type of logo.
