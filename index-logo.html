                    values of the Lithuaniana
                    school society, such as 
                    enthusiasm, solidarity

                    therefore are in leafy green and 
                    ground brown colors. The logos 
                    feature human, tree and circle
                    symbols  which in unison with the
                    colors help to allude to the
                    mentioned values.

                    a redesign of their whole brand 
                    identity, which would communicate
                    the heritage of the dance better

            <p>solution - with the logo, we 
            researched a lot about 20s and 30s
            when the dance originated. We took 
            inspiration from Art Deco and created
            an monogramic type of logo.

                made them into animations for the movie, 
                which solved the problem of lack of interest
                in the movie.
