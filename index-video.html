        <p>2018 “Seaways” music video clip</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRvBEJiqvso=1" title="cliche - Seaways"></iframe>
                <p>role - director & producer</p>
            <br>
            <p>problem - in this project I was 
                presented with a challenge to create
                a music video which would unravel the 
                meaning of the song and origin 
                of the band.                
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> solution - with the tool of animation 
                i made a music video clip which 
                supported the overall brand of the band 
                and their message in the song “Cliche”. 
                artistic animations of nature and earth 
                formed a visual meaning of such lyrics like
                “i was trying to find you, and 
                i think i was close”

        <p>2021 “How to frame a picture” video clip</p>
        <iframe src="https://youtu.be/EDJY4WYtGMk=1" title="cliche - Seaways"></iframe>
        <p>role - art director</p>
        <br>
        <p>problem - in this project our challenge
            was how to tell a compelling story 
            hrough the prism of a “How to..” video.                
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> solution - we took a simple idea for a 
            tutorial and spiced with a pun. as well as 
            that, we chose to mix in a medium of 
            stop-motion to tell a story of how to 
            frame a picture. in the outcome we got
            a charismatic and humoristic tutorial.
